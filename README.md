# Customer-Churn-Prediction
CUSTOMER - CHURN - LEARNING USING MACHINE LEARNING


This project uses customer data from a telecommunications company to predict customer churn using machine learning.
The goal is to identify customers who are most likely to leave the service, allowing the business to take proactive actions to improve customer retention.
A logistic regression model and a decision tree model were built and evaluated, with a tuned decision tree selected as the final model based on recall performance.
The project includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and model training, evaluation, and business recommendations.
