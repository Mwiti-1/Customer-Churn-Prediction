# Customer-Churn-Prediction
#Customer Churn prediction using machine learning.
This project uses customer data from a telecommunications company to predict customer churn using machine learning .
The goal is to identify customers who are most likely to leave the service so that the business can take proactive actions to improve customer retention.
A logistic regression model and a decision tree model were built and evaluated, with a tuned decision tree selected as the final model based on recall performance.
The project includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and model training, evaluation, and business recommendations.
